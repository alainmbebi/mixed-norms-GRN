# mixed-norms-GRN

R functions to implement all algorithms described in Gene regulatory network inference using mixed-norms regularized multivariate model with covariance selection.

1. The folder code contains the following R scripts with the K-folds cross-validation option to learn the hyperparameters :
  * Mixed_L1L21_GRN.R which computes L1L21 
  * Mixed_L1L21G_GRN.R which computes L1L21G
  * Mixed_L2L21_GRN.R which computes L2L21
  * Mixed_L2L21G_GRN.R which computes L2L21G


2. Although the codes here were tested on Fedora 29 (Workstation Edition) using R (version 3.6.1), they can run under any Linux or Windows OS distributions, as long as all the required packages are compatible with the desired R version.
